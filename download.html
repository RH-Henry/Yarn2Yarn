<h1>Important Information Before Downloading</h1>

<h2>Thank you for downloading Yarn 2 Yarn <3</h2>
    
<div class="warning">
    <strong>⚠ A Windows security window will appear.</strong><br>
    This is expected and happens the first time you run the software.
</div>

<h2>The window you are going to see</h2>

<p>
When launching the software for the first time, Windows will display a message saying:
<strong>“Windows protected your PC”</strong> and <strong>“Unknown publisher”</strong>.
</p>

<img src="https://support-portal.8x8.com/helpcenter/documents/2106/attachments/2744" alt="Windows protected your PC warning">
<p>
If you trust me, simply press
<strong>“More info”</strong> and <strong>“Run anyway”</strong>.
</p>
<h2>Why this window appears</h2>

<p>
By default, Microsoft Windows blocks or warns about any application that:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>is not signed with a very specific (and expensive) certificate</li>
    <li>or does not yet have enough “reputation” in Microsoft’s ecosystem</li>
</ul>

<p>
This software is developed by an <strong>independent developer</strong>, not a large corporation
paying for privileged treatment.
</p>

<div class="info">
    <strong>Important:</strong><br>
    This warning does <u>not</u> mean the software is dangerous, malicious, or infected.
    It only means that Microsoft cannot automatically vouch for the publisher
    unless a costly validation scheme is used.
</div>

<h2>Why this warning cannot simply be “removed”</h2>

<p>
To make this warning <strong>never appear</strong>, Microsoft requires a certificate called
<strong>EV (Extended Validation)</strong>.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Cost: approximately <strong>$400–$600 per year</strong></li>
    <li>Recurring annual payment</li>
    <li>Issued by a small number of private certification authorities</li>
</ul>

<p>
In practice, this certificate exists primarily to <strong>remove this screen</strong>.
It does not magically make the software more secure.
</p>

<div class="militant">
    <strong>Let’s be honest:</strong><br>
    This is a pay-to-remove-friction system.
    Independent developers are forced to pay a recurring fee to avoid scaring users,
    while large companies absorb the cost without blinking.
    <br><br>
    This is not about security.
    It is about control and monetization of trust by Microsoft and a handful of
    certificate authorities.
</div>

<h2>What to do to run the software</h2>

<div class="steps">
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Click <strong>“More info”</strong>.</p>
    <img src="https://kb.ayssoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Windows-10-SmartScreen.png" alt="More info button">

    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Click <strong>“Run anyway”</strong>.</p>
    <img src="https://vovsoft.com/blog/windows-protected-your-pc-click2.png" alt="Run anyway button">

    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>The software will launch normally. This is usually required only once.</p>
</div>

<h2>Refund option — no pressure</h2>

<div class="refund">
    <strong>If this bothers you:</strong><br>
    You are absolutely free to <strong>not install the software</strong>
    and request a <strong>refund</strong>.
    <br><br>
    No tricks, no forced installation.
    If you are uncomfortable with this Windows warning, simply do not proceed. Don't be afraid to contact me at yarn2yarn.desiknit@gmail.com, I will refund you manually. If I get enough sales I might buy some really expensive certificates but I don't want to sell a kidney for now, so thank you for your support if you decide to continue.
</div>

<h2>Transparency, accountability, and trust</h2>

<p>
This software:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>contains no malware</li>
    <li>contains no hidden data collection</li>
    <li>does not communicate with third-party servers, except for the license keys verification with lemon squeezy.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I am <strong>not anonymous</strong>.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>The payment platform (Lemon Squeezy) has my verified personal identity.</li>
    <li>This includes legal identification documents.</li>
    <li>I am legally accountable for this software.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If there is a problem, a bug, or a dispute:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>I can be contacted</li>
    <li>I can be identified</li>
    <li>I can be held responsible</li>
</ul>

<footer>
    <p>
        This page exists to be fully transparent about the realities imposed on
        independent developers by the Windows ecosystem.
        <br>
        Trust should be earned through honesty and responsibility — not rented annually.
